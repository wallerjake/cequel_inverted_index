Description:
    Creates the support files needed to provide an inverted index for
    cassandra databases using the Cequel gem.

Example:
    rails generate cequel_inverted_index MyAwesomeModel column_to_search_by

    This will create:
        - app\models\#{model}_#{column}_index.rb
          (A new Cequel model that implements the inverted index)
        - app\models\concerns\inverted_index.rb
          (A mixin for the above index model)
        - app\models\concerns\#{column}_search.rb
          (A mixin for the primary model to extend it's functionality)

    This will modify:
        - your primary model to include the above concern.

    The following methods will be available to your primary model class:
        - find_all_by_#{column}(value)
          (Returns all records with given value in indexed column)
        - count_with_#{column}(value)
          (Returns number of records with given value in indexed column)
        - any_with_#{column}?(value)
          (Returns true if any records have given value in the indexed column)

Notes:
    You will need to migrate your database after running the generator:
      `rake cequel:migrate`

    If you already have records in your database, your new index will not know
    about them.  You will need to re-index.
